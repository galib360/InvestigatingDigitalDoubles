> Creating human digital doubles is becoming easier and much more accessible to everyone using consumer grade devices. In this work, we investigate how avatar style (realistic vs cartoon) and avatar familiarity (self, acquaintance, unknown person) affect self/other-identification, perceived realism, affinity and social presence with a controlled offline experiment. We created two styles of avatars (realistic-looking MetaHumans and cartoon-looking ReadyPlayerMe avatars) and facial animations stimuli for them using performance capture. Questionnaire responses demonstrate that higher appearance realism leads to a higher level of identification, perceived realism and social presence. However, avatars with familiar faces, especially those with high appearance realism, lead to a lower levels of identification, perceived realism, and affinity. Although participants identified their digital doubles as their own, they consistently did not like their avatars, especially of realistic appearance. But they were less critical and more forgiving about their acquaintance's or an unknown person's digital double.

We investigate the perception of human digital doubles with realistic (top row) and stylized (bottom row) appearances and three levels of familiarity - self, acquaintance and unknown person.

The left figure demonstrates the step-by-step experiment procedure. The right figure the two participants conducting the Q&amp;A conversation task. The person on the left is asking questions while the person on the right outside the frame is the respondent whose facial performance is being captured.
